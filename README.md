### Course Description
This course focuses on the application of computational thinking using a 
problem-centered approach. Specific topics include: 
expression of algorithms in pseudo-code, and a programming language; 
data structures such as lists, trees and graphs; problem-solving
using recursion; and debugging and testing. 

Functions

    Conditionals
    Loops
    Defining functions
    Parameters, arguments, return values (including default None)

Recursion

    With setup functions
    base case(s) and recursive call(s), making sure recursion terminates
    Substitution traces

Python Collections

    String processing
    Python lists, tuples, sets
    Dictionaries
    Big-O basics

Searching & Sorting

    Linear search
    Binary search

Linked Lists

    Cursor-based interface
    Linked list with cursor
        Prepend, append
        Insert at cursor

Trees

    Traversals
    BST concept, interface
